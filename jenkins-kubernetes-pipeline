Steps to Deploy an Application to Kubernetes Using Jenkins
1. Install Required Plugins in Jenkins
You will need the following Jenkins plugins:

Kubernetes CLI Plugin: Allows Jenkins to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster.

Go to Jenkins Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available tab.

Search for the plugins mentioned above and install them.

2. Upload kubeconfig File as a Secret in Jenkins:

Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Manage Credentials → (Global) → Add Credentials.
Select "Secret file" as the credential type.
Upload the kubeconfig file.
Provide an ID (e.g., kubernetes-kubeconfig) and a description for this credential.

3. Install kubectl in jenkins machine 
Add /root/bin/ to Jenkins User's PATH
You can modify the Jenkins environment to include /root/bin in the PATH. To do this:

Open the Jenkins configuration file (on Ubuntu/Debian, it is usually /etc/default/jenkins):

sudo nano /etc/default/jenkins

ind the line starting with PATH= and append /root/bin to it. For example:

PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/root/bin

sudo systemctl restart jenkins

Move kubectl to a Directory Accessible by Jenkins
You can move the kubectl binary to a location that is globally accessible, such as /usr/local/bin:

sudo mv /root/bin/kubectl /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl

4. Use Sudo to Allow Jenkins to Execute kubectl

vi vi /etc/sudoers
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /root/bin/kubectl


5. Create a pipeline

pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        KUBECONFIG_SECRET_ID = 'kubernetes-kubeconfig' // ID of the kubeconfig stored as a Secret file
    }

    stages {
        stage('Git Stage') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/CloudSihmar/dummy-repo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([file(credentialsId: env.KUBECONFIG_SECRET_ID, variable: 'KUBECONFIG')]) {
                    sh '''
                        kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG apply -f deploy.yaml
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
